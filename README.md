# Identification of Tumor-Specific TCRs Based on the Transcriptomic Signature and Tumor Localization of TILs

This repository contains an ongoing single-cell analysis focused on identifying tumor-specific TCRs by integrating transcriptomic signatures and tumor localization of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). The study is based on **10 patients** with different tumor types:

- **5 ovarian cancer patients**
- **4 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients**
- **1 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patient**

**‚ö†Ô∏è This analysis is still in progress and subject to continuous updates.**

### üîπ **Spatial-TCR Analysis**
The `Spatial-TCR/` subdirectory contains ongoing analyses integrating **spatial transcriptomics and TCR sequencing**, aiming to **map tumor-reactive TCRs to their spatial location within the tumor microenvironment**.

This analysis is based on **Hudson et al.** *Distinct phenotypic states and spatial distribution of CD8+ T cell clonotypes in human brain metastases* (PMID: 35584630) and serves as a **technical validation and pipeline setup** for spatial TCR analysis.

- **Notebooks:**
  - `00_Analysis_spatial_hudson.ipynb` ‚Üí Processing spatial transcriptomics datasets.
  - `01_Analysis_TCR_Repertoire_Seurat.ipynb` ‚Üí Integrating spatial data with Seurat.
    
- **Raw data processing scripts** (inside `utility_scripts/`):
  - `download_scRNAseq.sh`
  - `download_spati_scRNAseq.sh`
  - `download_spati_TCR.sh`

### üîπ **Cell Ranger Pipeline**
The `Cellranger_scripts/` directory contains scripts used to preprocess **single-cell RNA-seq and TCR-seq data** from 10 patients using **Cell Ranger** for demultiplexing, alignment, and feature counting.

---

### üîπ **TCR Repertoire Analysis (Immcantation)**
The `Immcantation_repertoire_scripts/` directory includes **sample sheets and commands** for running the **Immcantation framework**, a powerful pipeline for TCR/BCR repertoire analysis.

---

## üöß **Work in Progress**
This project is still under active development. Some analyses are being optimized, and additional validation is required to confirm the tumor specificity of the identified TCRs. Future updates will include:

- **Refinement of single-cell annotation based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and literature-derived signatures**
- **Additional spatial transcriptomic datasets**
- **Functional avidity study using different methods and TCRdist-based physicochemical classification of TCRs**
